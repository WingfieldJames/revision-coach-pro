Discuss/Evaluate essays (20-25 marks): Introduction with stance, Main Body 1 (Argument For with analysis, diagram, mini-evaluation), Main Body 2 (Counter-argument with analysis, diagram, mini-evaluation), Main Body 3 (Context/Scenario application), Evaluative Conclusion with final judgement.', '{"content_type": "exam_technique", "topic": "Essay Architecture", "tier": "all"}'),

('9a710cf9-0523-4c1f-82c6-0e02b19087e5', 'CIE Economics Micro Evaluation Points: Taxes/Subsidies - Ceteris paribus rarely holds, elasticity determines effectiveness (inelastic demand means taxes generate revenue but dont reduce consumption), black markets from high taxes, information failure renders subsidies less effective, opportunity cost of subsidies. Market Structures - Monopolies are allocatively inefficient (P>MC) but may have dynamic efficiency from supernormal profits for R&D, natural monopoly preferable to duplication, contestability means monopoly may behave competitively, regulatory capture. Labour Markets - Minimum wage depends on elasticity of demand for labour, monopsony power means minimum wage can increase employment, substitution effect leads to automation, MRP difficult to measure in team-based service economy.', '{"content_type": "exam_technique", "topic": "Micro Evaluation Points", "tier": "all"}'),
('9a710cf9-0523-4c1f-82c6-0e02b19087e5', 'CIE Economics Macro Evaluation Points: Inflation/Unemployment - Demand-pull easier to cure than cost-push, expectations anchoring reduces monetary policy effectiveness, Phillips Curve valid short run but vertical LRPC long run, hysteresis from long-term unemployment. Fiscal/Monetary Policy - Time lags 12-18 months for monetary policy, crowding out from government borrowing, liquidity trap at 0% interest needs QE, Ricardian equivalence neutralizes fiscal stimulus. International Trade - J-Curve effect worsens current account initially, Marshall-Lerner condition (PEDx+PEDm>1), comparative advantage assumes perfect factor mobility, Prebisch-Singer declining terms of trade, FDI creates jobs but profits repatriated vs aid dependency.', '{"content_type": "exam_technique", "topic": "Macro Evaluation Points", "tier": "all"}'),

Focus on strongest 2 advantages and 2 disadvantages with full development - quality over quantity. Use precise terms: Real Disposable Income, Factors of Production, Liquidity (not money or resources). Tailor answers to context - developing economy means no advanced financial markets. Common mistakes: Change in Demand vs Change in Quantity Demanded (price moves along curve, non-price shifts curve), Macro/Micro mix-up (dont use Profit in macro, use Investment/GDP), One-sided essays cannot get above Level 3 without evaluation.
