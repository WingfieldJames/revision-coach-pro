  E'Exam Structure\n\nPaper 1 (Micro; Themes 1 & 3)\n\nLength/marks/weight = 2h | 100 marks | 35%. 3 sections.\n\nSection A (Q1–5 = 25 marks): per Q=5 marks → 5×1 MCQs (A–D) + 2 & 4-mark short answers(explain/apply/data/calcs/diagrams). Answer all. ~30 min.\n\nSection B (Q6 = 50 marks; unseen extracts/data; national/global focus):\n6a (5) KAA only (no eval)\n6b (8) KAA + Evaluation\n6c (10) 6 KAA / 4 Eval\n6d (12) 8 KAA / 4 Eval\n6e (15) 9 KAA / 6 Eval\nAnswer all. Tips: read Qs before extracts; highlight app points; ~60 min total (≈10 min reading + ≈1 min/mark).\n\nSection C (Q7–8; choose 1 = 25 marks): 16 KAA / 9 Eval; deep micro analysis/eval of factors/policies/outcomes; national/global context; use own examples with provided text/data. ~30 min.\n\nKAA = Knowledge, Application, Analysis; Eval = Evaluation.\n\nPaper 2 (Macro; Themes 2 & 4)\n\nLength/marks/weight = 2h | 100 marks | 35%. 3 sections.\n\nSection A (Q1–5 = 25): same structure as Paper 1 A. Answer all. ~30 min.\n\nSection B (Q6 = 50; unseen extracts/data; national/global focus): same subparts/mark splits as Paper 1 B. Answer all. Tips/time as P1.\n\nSection C (Q7–8; choose 1 = 25): 16 KAA / 9 Eval; deep macro analysis/eval; global/national context; apply own examples. ~30 min.\n\nPaper 3 (Synoptic; Micro + Macro across Themes 1–4)\n\nLength/marks/weight = 2h | 100 marks | 30%. 2 sections.\n\nSection A (Q1 = 50): answer 1(a)–1(c) then either 1(d) or 1(e).\n1a (5) points-marked KAA only (no eval).\n1b (8) points-marked KAA + Eval (text notes "8 KAA + 2 Eval" – check live mark scheme; treat as KAA+Eval points-marked).\n1c (12) level-marked 8 KAA / 4 Eval.\n1(d) or 1(e) (25) level-marked 16 KAA / 9 Eval; deep synoptic application/eval (micro and macro); global/national/market/business context; use own examples with extracts/data.\nTips: read (a)–(c) before extracts; highlight app; ≈1 min/mark; ~30 min for (a)–(c); ~30 min for 25-marker.\n\nSection B (Q2 = 50): answer 2(a)–2(c) then either 2(d) or 2(e) with identical structure/marks to Section A (including 2a=5 KAA only; 2b=8 KAA+Eval (text notes "8 KAA + 2 Eval" – verify); 2c=12 (8/4); 2(d)/2(e)=25 (16/9)). Same tips/timing.\n\nKAA Format for Responses\n\nKnowledge (K):\nDefine or state the principle or concept clearly.\n\nApplication (A):\nProvide relevant context or examples, such as data from extracts or real-world applications.\n\nAnalysis (A):\nDevelop a clear chain of reasoning that links cause and effect. Each chain should connect logically to the previous point.\n\nEvaluation (E):\nAssess the points made in the KAA sections. Consider factors such as:\n- Short-run vs long-run impacts\n- Magnitude of effects\n- Time lags\n- Different stakeholders\n- Conflicting objectives or opportunity costs\nUse clear reasoning and contextual support to weigh arguments.',
